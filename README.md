This was done in collaboration with a partner for our final project in CSE183, a Full-Stack web development course at UCSC.
Last updated June 2019.

This project is a player statistics website for the video game League of Legends. 
The developer API key needs to be re-generated every few days for the website to work. 

Google Charts, Html, Python, CSS. JavaScript, Riot API, and Cassiopeia are some of the tools used to build this website. It is currently not a live website.
